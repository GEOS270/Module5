## Working Examples

This project contains models with examples of methods that can be applied to vector data, using some data from Burns Bog.  You can follow along in lecture or download the project and play around with the data on your own.

The methods covered include: 

* Merging vector layers
* Buffering
* Clipping
* Erasing
* Intersecting
* Unioning
* Dissolving
* Converting a vector to raster
