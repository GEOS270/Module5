<p><a href="Application_Part1.md#Traditional-knowlege-and-records-of-past-tsunamis"><strong>1</strong></a> What does the example presented in Ludwin et al. 2005 say about the value that the sciences have historically attributed to traditional knowledge when it comes to understanding our world?</p>

<!-- The sciences have tended to have a bias against and non-white/colonial/male knowledge/sources -->

<p><a href="Application_Part1.md#unique-geography"><strong>2</strong></a> The maximum wave height recorded at Tofino was only <em>__</em> meters.  Despite this, wave heights exceeded 8 meters in Port Alberni.</p>

<!-- 2.4 -->

<p><a href="Application_Part1.md#simulated-save-heights"><strong>3</strong></a> Look back at Ludwin et al. 2005, specifically at the story of Pachena Bay (bottom pg 142 to top of pg 143).  You can find a <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/native-american-stories/other-stories/the-tsunami-at-anaqtl-a-or-pachena-bay">full transcription here</a>.  Find Pachena Bay on google maps.  Where is it relative to Port Alberni?  What can you infer from this story, the account in Fine et al (2008), and the simulation of wave heights about how a megathrust earthquake occurring just off of the coast of Vancouver Island would impact Port Alberni?</p>

<!-- The whole village was destroyed.  Only ppl up high on the hill survived.  The bay has a shorter but similar shape to the alberni inlet.  An equivalent earthquake would be VERY bad. -->

<p><a href="Application_Part2.md#port-alberni-data"><strong>4</strong></a> Why do we use a feature dataset to hold all our input layers?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No reason</li>
  <li>So everything is neatly grouped in one folder</li>
  <li>To ensure all our vector data is in the same projection, the feature dataset will automatically re-project our vector data when importing</li>
  <li>To ensure all our vector and raster data is in the same projection, the feature dataset will automatically re-project our vector and raster data when importing</li>
</ul>

<!-- C -->

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#automating-with-model-builder"><strong>5</strong></a> Why are we using model builder for this analysis?  Select all that apply</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your analysis is easily repeatable when using model builder</li>
  <li>You can easily update your analysis</li>
  <li>You can visualize your workflow</li>
  <li>You can share your workflow with others</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#clip-the-roads-layer"><strong>6</strong></a></p>

<p>How many <strong>km</strong> of roads are at risk?  Rounded to the nearest tenth km is fine.  <em>Hint</em> Open the attribute, of PA_Roads_Flood, click right Click Shape_Length » Statistics to find the sum.</p>

<!-- 31.16 -->

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#select-properties-by-location"><strong>17</strong></a> How many residential properties (sum of Residential and Multi-Family Residential) are are at risk?  Reference the bar chart you created.</p>

<!-- 689 -->

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md"><strong>18</strong></a></p>

<p>How many <strong>km</strong> of roadways are at risk of flooding? Rounded to the nearest tenth km is fine.  <strong>Note</strong> this answer will be higher than your answer to Question 16 because we increased the threshold.</p>

<!-- 44.3 -->

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md"><strong>19</strong></a></p>

<p>How many properties (of any kind) are at risk of flooding?</p>

<!-- 1413 -->

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md"><strong>20</strong></a></p>

<p>How many people are potentially at risk of displacement?  <strong>Round up to the nearest whole number</strong></p>

<!-- 2038 -->

<p>How many shelters are in suitable locations?</p>
