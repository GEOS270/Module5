<p>Spatial sampling is the way we collect data to to bring it into a GIS in the first place.  It is essential to take representative samples, so that we can adequately represent the phenomena we wish to understand.</p>

<!-- # Conceptual Background


## Spatial Autocorrelation 

The topics covered in this section build upon Tobler s First Law of Geography and the concept of **Spatial Autocorrelation**.  I've already covered these topics a bit, and we'll talk about them again later on down the line because this concept is one of the central themes of GIS.  This video gives a quick review of the concepts and then explains why spatial autocorrelation can be a serious issue when working with data.

## Spatial Heterogeneity

Spatial heterogeneity is another essential concept in the geographic sciences.  This video introduces the concept, some of the problems it can lead to in GIS, and what we can do to account for that.

# Sampling Spatial Data and Making Spatial Inferences

With the concepts of spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity in mind, we can determine think about the appropriate methods for sampling spatial data.  We can also think about methods to estimate (infer) values between samples.  This video introduces the different methods we use to sample spatial data and some of their respective pros and cons.  It also introduces the concept of spatial interpolation and discusses a specific method known as Inverse Distance Weighting.
