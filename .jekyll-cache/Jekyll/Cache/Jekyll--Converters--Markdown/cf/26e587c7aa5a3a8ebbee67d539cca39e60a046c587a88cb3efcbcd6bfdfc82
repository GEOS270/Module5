<h1 id="the-cascadia-subduction-zone">The Cascadia Subduction Zone</h1>

<p>Just off of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone">Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ)</a>. Until recently, the common scientific theory was that the CSZ was incapable of producing megathrust earthquakes and their associated Tsunami‚Äôs because ‚Äúno sizable earthquake has occurred on it since European settlement began‚Äù (Ludwin et al. 2005).</p>

<p><img src="content/images/CSZ.png" alt="hi" class="inline" /></p>

<h2 id="traditional-knowledge-and-records-of-past-tsunamis">Traditional Knowledge and Records of Past Tsunamis</h2>

<p>Despite the scientific communities‚Äô assumptions that the CSZ was not a threat, knowledge of the destructive potential of the CSZ was preserved in the oral histories of coastal indigenous peoples from British Columbia to Northern California.  There are numerous histories describing a massive earthquake and tsunami that occurred sometime around 1700.  These histories were transcribed between 1860 and 1964.  Read the highlighted sections of Ludwin et al. (2005), which can be found <a href="https://github.com/GEOS270/Module5/raw/main/data/Readings/LudwinEtAl.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until the 1990‚Äôs that scientific research began to shown that the CSZ was capable of producing megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis.  Tree ring studies and historical accounts of a Tsunami in Japan pinpoint the timing of the last major CSZ earthquake at 21:00 Pacific time on January 26, 1700.  In fact, there have been at least seven megathrust earthquakes exceeding 8.0 magnitude in the last 3500 years.  The recurrence interval for massive earthquakes along this fault line are estimated to be between 243 and 500 years.  In 2010, geologists predicted a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.2+ event within 50 years, and a 10 to 15% chance that the entire Cascadia subduction zone will rupture with a magnitude 9+ event within the same time frame.</p>

<p>This example highlights both the arrogance of the scientific community and the lack of value it has historically attributed to traditional knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="unique-geography">Unique Geography</h2>

<p>On March 28th, 1964 a megathrust earthquake (9.2 magnitude on the Richter scale) occurred in southern Alaska.  Known as the ‚ÄúGood Friday‚Äù earthquake, it was responsible for 131 deaths: 9 from the earthquake itself, and 122 from the subsequent Tsunami, reaching as far away as Crescent City, California.  In British Columbia, the Tsunami‚Äôs impacts were most devastating in Port Alberni, where 55 homes were washed away and 375 more were damaged.  Port Alberni is especially vulnerable to Tsunamis because of its specific geography.  Located at the head of 40km long fjord, Tsunami waves are amplified as they are funneled up the fjord.  Read the highlighted portions of the introduction section in Fine et al (2008) which can be found <a href="https://github.com/GEOS270/Module5/raw/main/data/Readings/FineEtAl.pdf">here</a> .  You can also watch the simulation shown below for a visualization of what is going on.</p>

<h1 id="defining-the-project-area">Defining the Project Area</h1>

<p>In light of this research, the city of Port Alberni submitted an application for funding to update their Tsunami warning and response infrastructure.  The city was recently granted funding and has hired you as a GIS consultant to assess the potential impacts of an 8.5 magnitude earthquake occurring directly off the west coast of Vancouver Island that would produce an estimated wave height of 10 meters.</p>

<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>

<p>How would a catastrophic tsunami potentially impact Port Alberni?  The city wants to know:</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> Which roads are at risk of flooding or damage?</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> Which properties in the city are at risk?</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> How many people in Port Alberni are potentially living in areas at risk?</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">4</strong> Are the Tsunami Shelters sufficient?</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p><strong class="label">1</strong> Identify at risk areas based on elevation and distance from coast.</p>

<p><strong class="label">2</strong> Overlay vector layers to highlight features at risk.</p>

<p><strong class="label">3</strong> Visualize and analyze the results.</p>
